# Dataset: How Do Arab Tweeters Perceive the COVID-19 Pandemic?

## Abstract

Language reflects several cognitive variables grounded in cognitive linguistics, psycholinguistics, and sociolinguistics. This dataset examines how Arab populations reacted to the COVID-19 pandemic on Twitter over twelve weeks since the outbreak. 

We conducted a **lexicon-based thematic analysis** using:
- Corpus tools
- LIWC
- R language’s `stylo` package

The dominant themes closely related to coronavirus tweets included:
- The outbreak of the pandemic
- Metaphysical responses
- Signs and symptoms in confirmed cases
- Conspiracism

The psycholinguistic analysis revealed that tweeters maintained high levels of affective talk loaded with negative emotions and sadness. **LIWC’s psychological categories of religion and health** dominated the Arabic tweets discussing the pandemic situation.

Geographical focus included:
- Most attention: China, the USA, Italy, Germany, India, and Japan
- Conspiracist ideation: China and the USA were instrumental in evoking discussions about spreading COVID-19 to the world.
