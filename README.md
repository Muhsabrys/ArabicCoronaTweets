# Dataset: Linguistic Styles and Figurative Meaning in COVID-19 Discussions on Twitter

## Abstract

Language represents advanced aspects of human cognition, making the study of linguistic styles and figurative meanings effective in measuring embodied cognition about the external world. This dataset explores the most worrisome topics discussed from Weeks 1 to 14 after the COVID-19 outbreak, comparing the literal use of words to the figurative use of metaphoric expressions. 

We bootstrapped representative data from Twitter over 14 weeks since the inception of the outbreak. The dataset was analyzed thematically using the **Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC) 2015 software** and corpus tools. The **MetaNet database**, corpus tools, and manual annotation were employed to detect expressions linguistically mapped to a formalized list of conceptual metaphors. 

The most frequently tagged themes include:
- The outbreak of the pandemic
- Its epidemiology
- Prophylaxis measures
- National and world economies
- Media
- Signs and symptoms of COVID-19

Although LIWC-based analysis showed that English-speaking tweeters maintained high levels of analytical thinking, elevated levels of anger, anxiety, and doubtfulness were also observed. Discrepancies and improper conceptualization of the clinical picture of the pandemic were noted.
